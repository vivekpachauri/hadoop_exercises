Lab Steps
1.	
Store the Job Data in HDFS
1.	
Make sure you have whitehouse/visits.txt in HDFS:

root@ubuntu:~# hadoop fs -ls whitehouse

If not, the file can be found in the Getting Started with Pig lab folder. The Oozie job assumes there is a file named visits.txt in a folder named whitehouse in HDFS.
2.	
Deploy the Oozie Workflow
1.	
Using the gedit text editor, open the file /root/devph/labs/Oozie/workflow.xml.
2.	
How many actions are in this workflow? _____________

Answer: Two
3.	
Which action will execute first? _________________

Answer: The Pig action named export_congress
4.	
If the first action is successful, which action will execute next? ____________

Answer: The Hive action named define_congress_table
5.	
To deploy this workflow, we need a directory in HDFS:

root@ubuntu:~# cd ~/devph/labs/Oozie/
root@ubuntu:~/devph/labs/Oozie# hadoop fs -mkdir congress
6.	
Pull congress_visits.hive and whitehouse.pig from the Oozie folder into the new congress folder in HDFS.
7.	
Also, put workflow.xml into the congress folder.
8.	
Verify that you have three files now in your congress folder in HDFS:

root@ubuntu:~/devph/labs/Oozie# hadoop fs -ls congress
Found 3 items
-rw-r--r-- 3 root root 429 congress/congress_visits.hive
-rw-r--r-- 3 root root 580 congress/whitehouse.pig
-rw-r--r-- 3 root root 1692 congress/workflow.xml
3.	
Deploy the Hive Configuration File
1.	
If you look at the Hive action in workflow.xml, you will notice that it references a file named hive-site.xml within the <job-xml> tag. This file represents the settings Oozie needs to connect to your Hive instance, and the file needs to be deployed in HDFS (using a relative path to the workflow directory). Put hive-site.xml into the workflow directory:

# hadoop fs -put /etc/hive/conf/hive-site.xml congress
4.	
Define the OOZIE_URL Environment Variable
1.	
Although not required, you can simplify oozie commands by defining the OOZIE_URL environment variable. From the command line, enter the following command:

# export OOZIE_URL=http://hiveserver:11000/oozie
5.	
Run the Workflow
1.	
Run the workflow with the following command from the /root/devph/labs/Oozie directory:

# oozie job -config job.properties â€“run

If successful, the job ID should be displayed at the command prompt.
6.	
Monitor the Workflow
1.	
Point your Web browser to the Oozie Web Console:

http://hiveserver:11000/oozie/

You should see your Oozie job in the list of workflow jobs:
 
2.	
Double-click on the Job ID to the Job Info page:
 
3.	
Notice that you can view the status of each Action within the workflow.
7.	
Verify the Results
1.	
Once the Oozie job is completed successfully, start the Hive Shell.
2.	
Run a select statement on congress_visits and verify that the table is populated:

hive> select * from congress_visits;
...
