Demo Steps
1	Put the Small Files in HDFS
1.1	Change directories to the demos folder:
# cd ~/java/labs/demos/WordCount2
Notice there are three small text files in this folder: the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.
1.2	Make a new folder in HDFS named smallfiles:
# hadoop fs -mkdir smallfiles
1.3	Put the three text files into the smallfiles folder in HDFS:
# hadoop fs -put *.txt smallfiles
2	Run WordCount
2.1	From the WordCount2 folder, run the WordCount application on the smallfiles folder:
# yarn jar wordcount1.jar smallfiles output1
2.2	How many mappers did this MapReduce job use? _____________________ Answer: Three
2.3	Make sure the output file was created successfully:
# hadoop fs -ls output1
Found 2 items
-rw-r--r--   3 root root          0 output1/_SUCCESS
-rw-r--r--   3 root root      22528 output1/part-r-00000
3	View the Custom CombineFileInputFormat
3.1	View the contents of WordCountJob.java in the demos folder (or you can import the WordCount2 project into Eclipse). What is the input format for this job? ________________________________ Answer: MyCombinedFilesInputFormat.class
3.2	What is the maximum size of the input splits for this job? _______________ Answer: 50,000 bytes
3.3	View the MyCombinedFilesInputFormat.java file. What is this input format using for its RecordReader? ______________________________ Answer: MyCombinedFilesRecordReader.class
4	Run the Job Again
4.1	The wordcount1.jar job that was previously executed used a TextInputFormat. The wordcount2.jar uses the MyCombinedFilesInputFormat. Run the job using this custom input format:
# yarn jar wordcount2.jar smallfiles output2
4.2	How many mappers were used and why? _____________________________ Answer: Two mappers, which means the input must have been more than 50,000 bytes but less than 100,000 bytes
4.3	View the contents of output2 , and verify that the end result is the same. The main difference between wordcount1.jar and wordcount2.jar is the size of the input splits (and therefore the number of mappers).
