Lab Steps
1	Define a Hive Table
1.1	From a Terminal window, change directories to ~/java/labs/Lab11.1/Hive. You should see a file named importstock.hive. View its contents and see if you can determine what it does:
# more importstocks.hive
1.2	Run the importstocks.hive script using the following command:
# hive -f importstocks.hive
1.3	Verify data is in the stocks table using the Hive CLI:
# hive
hive> SELECT * FROM stocks LIMIT 100;
2	View the Project
2.1	In Eclipse, expand the folder of the Hive project.
2.2	Define a new package named hiveudfs .
3	Write a UDF Class
3.1	Add a class named MoneyFlow to the hiveudfs package that extends the UDF class.
3.2	Add an evaluate method that has the following signature:
public DoubleWritable evaluate(double high, double low, double close, int volume)
3.3	Compute and return the money flow from evaluate, which is computed with the following formulas:
typical price = (high + low + close) / 3
money flow = typical price x volume
3.4	Save your changes to MoneyFlow.java.
4	Build the JAR
4.1	Build the project to create hiveudfs.jar.
5	Write a Hive Script
5.1	Create a new text file in /root/java/workspace/Hive named moneyflow.hive.
5.2	Use the ADD JAR command to register hiveudfs.jar.
5.3	Define your hiveudfs.MoneyFlow class as a temporary function named ‘ moneyflow ’.
5.4	Write a SELECT query that retrieves the symbol, priceDate and moneyflow (by invoking the moneyflow function) from the stocks table:
SELECT symbol, pricedate, moneyflow(high, low, close, volume) FROM stocks LIMIT 10000;
5.5	Save your changes to moneyflow.hive.
6	Run the Hive Script
6.1	Run the script using the following command:
# hive -f moneyflow.hive
6.1	To verify, the end of your output should look like the following:

 	Result: In this lab, you defined a Hive table named stocks and populated it with data from a CSV file. Then you wrote a Hive UDF to compute the money flow of the data in stocks, and tested the UDF with a Hive script.
